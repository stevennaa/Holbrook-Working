## Our progress:

At the moment, we have the analysis on two countries, Uganda and India, that we will be comparing. 

We are working on our economic analysis (possible tax and change in deadweight loss) as well as Unit Tests.

# Two Sections:

## Project 4 Uganda Code

For this section, only run the master notebook.

## Project 4 India Code

This runs by itself.
