## Our progress:

At the moment, we have the analysis on two countries, Uganda and India, that we will be comparing. 

We are working on our economic analysis (possible tax and change in deadweight loss) as well as Unit Tests. The data needed to run the master notebook is included in the separate file named 'data' which contains both Ugandan and Indian nutritional datasets. Loading these data into your environment is vital towards attaining our results/output. 

# Two Sections:

## Project 4 Uganda Code

For this section, only run the master notebook.

## Project 4 India Code

This runs by itself.


# Extras:
## Population Growth & Malnutrition 

In order to run these visualizations. The commented lines must be installed so that the proper software is installed. The files 'mal.py' an 'pop_growth.py' are helpful towards generating insights regarding population and nutritional adequacy. This provides a greater understanding for our video presentation which references the analysis and insights generated from these visualizations.

## Unit Testing

In order to ensure smooth operations and ability for other groups to run and understand our code. We implemented Unittesting using the unittest library. The unit tests are located in the master notebook, which will help to diagose and understand any encountered issues. Along with providing a better understanding for what the output of the master_notebook.ipynb cells are supposed to be.
